## 24/7 Support promise

To **live up to your 24/7 Support promise** in a way that’s both reliable and scalable, you’ll want to design it as a **layered, always-available system**—so it doesn’t depend on one single channel or team being “always awake.”

Here’s how you can structure it:

---

## **1\. Multiple Support Channels**

* **Live Chat**:

  * AI-powered chatbot for instant answers and triaging (e.g., FAQs, status checks, booking changes).

  * Human takeover when the bot cannot solve an issue.

* **Email Support**:

  * 24/7 monitored inbox with SLA response targets (e.g., urgent \< 1 hour, normal \< 12 hours).

  * Auto-response confirming receipt and expected timeframe.

* **Phone Support**:

  * VoIP system with call routing to on-duty agents.

  * After-hours call forwarding to a rotating on-call team.

---

## **2\. Team Structure**

* **Follow-the-Sun Model**:

  * Distribute team members across time zones so someone is always available.

  * Ensure overlapping shifts for handovers and continuity.

* **Tiered Support**:

  * Tier 1 handles common and straightforward issues.

  * Tier 2/Tier 3 handles technical or complex problems, available on-call.

---

## **3\. Escalation & Monitoring**

* **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)** with escalation triggers if response times are exceeded.

* **Incident Management System** (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, or custom ticket system) to track progress and ensure nothing slips through.

* **Proactive Monitoring**:

  * Use automated alerts (e.g., server downtime, API failure) so your team can start resolving before users notice.

---

## **4\. Knowledge & Self-Service**

* Maintain an **up-to-date help center** with guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting tips.

* Integrate **AI-assisted knowledge base search** into chat so customers can self-resolve 24/7.

---

## **5\. Quality & Consistency**

* Standardize **support scripts** and tone guidelines to keep responses professional and consistent.

* **Monthly quality audits** and training refreshers.

---

✅ **Example Workflow**:

1. **Customer** opens chat at 2 AM.

2. **AI bot** answers instantly → detects issue is account-specific → routes to on-call Tier 1 agent.

3. **Agent** resolves or escalates to Tier 2 via ticket.

4. **Customer** gets resolution \+ follow-up email with details and prevention tips.

---

If you’d like, I can **map this into a working external support application** that links to your API, so customers can log tickets, chat live, and get phone callback requests—all without touching your main production site. That would make this **promise both real and demonstrable**.

Do you want me to sketch that **support app system architecture** next?
